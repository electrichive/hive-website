  Electric Hive Website Project

We could consider using a documentation tool like [React Styleguidist](https://github.com/styleguidist/react-styleguidist). Generally good practice, especially because the website needs to be not just functional but also educational. I have implemented a working example for the Header component.

UPDATE: Very difficult to configure for Gatsby! I have also tried Storybook to no avail. We can probably discard this as a feature for later until there is an actual solution from Gatsby.
